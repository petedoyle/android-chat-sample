### Best-practices infrastructure for starting a new Android app, *fast.* ðŸ”¥
Start your next app ***less than five minutes*** with full support for the Gradle Kotlin DSL, Dagger 2, multi-module builds, and CI. 

Minimally opinionated, it provides:

- **100% Kotlin**
- **Generated Android project** as created by Android Studio (3.5 Canary 10)
- **Gradle [Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html)**
- **buildSrc [pattern](https://handstandsam.com/2018/02/11/kotlin-buildsrc-for-better-gradle-dependency-management/)** for better dependency management and multi-module development
- **Dagger 2 pre-configured -** with *just* enough code to help understand the tricky [Kotlin](https://github.com/petedoyle/android-starter/blob/fa07f0b2eb14193732ebec610974c082af81f524/app/src/main/java/dev/petedoyle/starter/features/main/MainModule.kt#L11-L22) [syntax](https://github.com/petedoyle/android-starter/blob/fa07f0b2eb14193732ebec610974c082af81f524/app/src/main/java/dev/petedoyle/starter/features/main/MainActivity.kt#L12-L13)
- **Kotlin experimental extensions** so you can use [Parcelize](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/android-plugin.html#parcelable) on data classes
- **Packaging by feature -** Lots of benefits, but also makes it easier to later use Gradle modules to improve build speeds
- **Kotlin code formatting -** based on the official [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html), with small tweaks:
     - 120 character line limit
     - 4 space continuation indent (instead of 8)
     - Support for `@formatter:on` and `@formatter:off` tags

It *does not provide*:

- **Architecture -** Use MVVM, MVP, MVI, or roll your own.
- **Persistence -** Use Room, SQLDelight, etc.
- **Other Libraries -** 
    - Async - Use RxJava, Coroutines, etc.
    - HTTP loading - Use Retrofit, etc.
    - JSON parsing - Use GSON, Moshi, etc.
    - Photo loading - Use Picasso, Glide, etc.
    - Logging - Use Timber, etc.
    - Crash logging - Use Crashlytics, etc.


#### Coming soon
- **Rename default package** (currently `dev.petedoyle.starter`)
- **Incremental annotation processing -** for faster builds (waiting for a few more annotation processors to [support](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/subprojects/docs/src/docs/userguide/java_plugin.adoc#state-of-support-in-popular-annotation-processors) it)
- **Automatic `versionCode` management -** for CI builds
- Sample CircleCI config that:
    - Runs espresso tests on an emulator
    - Manual approval step to automatically the development branch to `master`
    - Manual approval step to push the newest build from `master` to Google Play
    - (as samples to start from)

#### Investigating
- Fastlane support

## Starting a new app
1. Decide on your app's repo name (e.g. `myapp`)

    ```
    $ KINDLING_REPO_NAME=myapp
    ```
2. Create your new repo:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/petedoyle/kindling.git $KINDLING_REPO_NAME && \
        cd $KINDLING_REPO_NAME && \
        AS_VERSION="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)@$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" && \
        rm -rf .git && \
        git init && \
        git add . && \
        git commit -m "Create new project from github.com/petedoyle/kindling ($AS_VERSION)" && \
        unset KINDLING_REPO_NAME
    ```

3. Open `myapp/build.gradle.kts` in Android Studio. Or, if you've installed the command line launcher:

    ```
    $ studio build.gradle.kts
    ```

***That's it! You're ready to dev!*** ðŸ”¥

## Finding your way around

- See `MainActivity` to see the sample activity. Note the package: `dev.petedoyle.starter.feature.main`.
- See `MainModule` to see how `MainActivity`'s dependencies can be provided. The lifetime of `MainModule`'s object graph is scoped to `MainActivity` (because `@ContributesAndroidInjector` in `ActivityBindingModule` created a Dagger `Subcomponent` under the hood, scoped to `MainActivity`).
- See `AppModule` to see how app-wide dependencies can be provided.
- See `buildSrc/src/main/java/Dependencies.kt` for declaring libraries and their versions.
- See `app/build.gradle` to see how to consume libraries, e.g.

    ```
    implementation(Deps.androidx_appcompat)
    ```
- See `daggerutil/build.gradle.kts` to see how to set up a module's build script.
- See how multiple modules' `build.gradle.kts` refer to `Deps.[name]`, thus allowing you to update dependency versions across many gradle modules at once.
